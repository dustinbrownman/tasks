# Tasks

This is my first Ruby on Rails app. Built as part of my learning process at
[Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). My goal is to become more familiar with the Ruby on Rails
development process, especially the model-view-controller paradigm. It is a little rough around the
edges, as I'm still trying to get my head around all this.

Before running the app, run `bundle install` to install the necessary gems, `rake db:create` to
create your database, and then `rake db:schema:load` to load the database schema.

To start the app, enter the directory from the command line, enter `rails s` and visit 
`http://localhost:3000` on your browser of choice.

Enjoy!
