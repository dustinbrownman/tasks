Tasks

A Ruby on Rails tasks app. Made as part of my learning process at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/).

Before running the app, run `bundle install` to install the necessary gems, `rake db:create` to create your database, and then `rake db:schema:load` to load the database schema.

To start the app, I think you run `ruby bin/wikitasks.rb`. I haven't got that yet :)

Enjoy!
