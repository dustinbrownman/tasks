# Tasks

This is my first Ruby on Rails app. Built as part of my learning process at
[Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). My goal is to become more familiar with the Ruby on Rails
development process, especially the model-view-controller paradigm. This would be a great place to
impliment some AJAX, though I'm not worrying about that until later. Also need to include a way to
delete tasks. The destroy action is in the controller, but I didn't like the way it was implimented,
so I took it out.

Before running the app, run `bundle install` to install the necessary gems, `rake db:create` to
create your database, and then `rake db:schema:load` to load the database schema.

To start the app, enter the directory from the command line, enter `rails s` and visit 
`http://localhost:3000` on your browser of choice.

Enjoy!
